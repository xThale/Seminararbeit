# Prinzipien und Anwendung des Softwaredesigns anhand von Schichten- und Hexagonaler Architektur

As an elective subject I chose to write a paper and hold a presentation about the principles and application of software design by analyzing and comparing layered and hexagonal architecture. This was done in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), which is an open source software for writing scientific papers. This topic was chosen by me to improve my in-depth knowledge of software design and help me prepare for the bachelor thesis.
